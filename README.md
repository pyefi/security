# Pye Security

Welcome to the official security repository for Pye. Our mission is to build validator-centric DeFi products, at the core of this effort is security. We made this repo to share audits, bug bounties and submission procedures for security disclosures.

## Audits

Pye Protocol contracts and programs undergo 3rd party audits before deployment. Audits reports are organized in the repository according to auditor and date of review.
